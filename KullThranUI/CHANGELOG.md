## 0.0.4 (2026-09-24)

## 0.0.3 (2026-09-20)

Forever beta follow-up focused on the Forever-native layout, options, installer, and release flow.

- Reworked KUI Move as KUI Move Forever with a curated Forever frame catalogue, Forever-specific naming, aliases, frame toggles, position and scale controls, and safe Settings fallback handling.

- Corrected Forever default layout handling for Unlock Mode elements, including Equipment Durability, Focus, Focus Target, Pet, and Target of Target while accommodating Forever SavedVariables limitations.

- Adjusted Armory layout and stat presentation to keep the character, equipment slots, original Blizzard stats, and KUI stats visible without panel overlap.
- Made Cast Bar and Resource Bars use the intended Forever defaults, including fixed width behavior, matching resource-bar dimensions, and mana on the pet bar.

## 0.0.2 (2026-09-19)

Cumulative WoW Forever beta release notes from the 0.0.1 baseline. This branch is versioned independently from Retail 5.0.7.

- Updated the package, core addon, module TOCs, MinimapStats metadata, release tooling, and in-game version sources to 0.0.2.
- Added Forever/Camelot detection and compatibility guards for the reduced API surface, specialization data, item information, range checks, protected values, and secret values.
- Hardened startup, AceDB/profile ownership, saved-variable migration, Installer state, changelog suppression, language selection, reload continuation, and Unlock Mode persistence.
- Fixed the Installer Don't show again state so it remains selected after reload and no longer reopens on every login; preserved the changelog suppression migration from 5.0.7.
- Connected Experience Bar to the current Unlock Mode registry, restored its visibility, position saving, and a safe default above the Blizzard action bars while Forever saved variables are incomplete.
- Removed Dragon Riding from the Forever-facing module flow and removed Mythic+ Timer from the Forever TOC, Installer, previews, and startup; retained Mythic+ History as normal Dungeon History.
- Disabled Combat Timer by default and migrated old profiles without overwriting an explicit later user choice.
- Added Forever-safe Aura Reminders filtering for available auras, weapon enchants, instance reminders, and Party Frame missing-buff reminders.
- Added Unit Frame and Party Frame level and PvP indicators, configurable typography and offsets, Elite/Rare classification indicators, circular portrait defaults, portrait borders, and correct overlay strata.
- Added visible Unit Frames and Party Frames toggles and live-preview rendering for level and PvP indicators; Target PvP now sits outside the right side of a right-hand portrait.
- Moved Target portrait to the right by default and made Target level, PvP, and classification indicators follow the actual portrait anchor whenever the portrait is moved.
- Corrected Unit Frames and Party Frames module enable toggles and made dispel overlay toggles apply immediately to every relevant aura/border path.
- Added configurable friendly-player levels to Nameplates and retained shared font, size, outline, shadow, color, X, and Y controls.
- Restyled Objective Tracker quest titles with the accent color across Forever legacy tracker blocks and added safer tracker discovery without assuming Retail ScrollBox APIs.
- Restored Armory visibility and Forever-compatible stats handling without feeding missing Retail stat strings into Blizzard tooltip formatters.
- Hardened BlizzMove for Forever build/version semantics, accepted existing Forever frames marked with obsolete Retail ranges, and suppressed expected missing-frame noise.
- Fixed Skins option builders and other Forever frame/API differences that caused nil callback failures.
- Protected TeleportMenu cooldown comparisons, Action Bar and TextStatusBar paths, and other tainted/secret-number operations from Lua arithmetic and comparisons.
- Patched Rogue/Feral Combo Points in Resource Bars, Unit Frames custom Class Power, oUF ClassPower, and the oUF cpoints tag; Feral-only Druid mapping avoids applying Combo Points to other Druid specs.
- Fixed Aura Reminders and Party Frame APIs for Forever-only spell/item availability and removed Retail-only assumptions from reminder catalogs.
- Improved Chat whisper history so all outgoing whispers display, including Forever events with lineID 0, while keeping protected native chat handling safe.
- Moved the default Damage Meter position down and left, improved its protected-value handling, and kept custom user positions intact.
- Kept diagnostics available through /ktdebug and /ktpersistdebug, with persistence logging disabled by default after the migration was verified.
- Validated changed Lua files with Lua 5.1 syntax checks and validated repository whitespace with git diff --check.

## 5.0.7 (2026-09-18)
- Added WoW Forever and WoW Forever Beta detection to Enhanced Friend List, including the dedicated WoW Forever artwork and distinct tooltip labels.

- Fixed Raid Warning taint caused by secret or unit-derived values by using a safe static warning message and protected-value checks.
- Improved Chat handling for protected and secret message data, including safer whisper capture and native channel integration.
- Refined Minimap utility-button collection and restoration so addon launchers are handled without disturbing Blizzard's map, waypoint, POI, or scanner controls.

- Hardened Aura Reminders, Nameplates text rendering, and Modern KUI skins for current protected UI and Blizzard frame changes.

## 5.0.6 (2026-09-13)
- New Feature: Mythic+ History. A detailed Mythic+ history has been added to the Enhancements module, allowing you to track completed keys and view a keystone summary breakdown, including a damage meter to see who did the most DPS during the run. NOTE: The Mythic+ History will only display all party members after activating the submodule, as KullThranUI needs to start saving the runs internally from that point forward.
- Localization updates: Translations have been applied across all KullThranUI modules. Localization and compatibility have been expanded to cover 97% of the addon and its features. Added country flags to easily     distinguish languages. Fixed translation errors across several Widget elements and the Enhancements submodule.
- Skins module update: New visual style applied. Improved the visibility and overall readability of the reskinned default Blizzard frames.
- Added a scrollbar to the Widget system. It will now appear automatically in all modules that have enough options to require scrolling.
- Added a Minimap button to open KUI options directly.
- Fixed an issue in the Objective Tracker where the 'Scenario' header would display even when not inside an instance.
- Fixed KUI Tracker behavior in the CooldownManager. Potion and Warlock Healthstone cooldowns will now properly reset after a raid boss wipe/reset (when the appropriate conditions are met).
- KullThranUI is now officially available on GitHub! Future updates for CurseForge and Wago will be deployed from there, and Pull Requests will soon be enabled so the community can help improve translations.

- Promoted Melli Reforged to the default status-bar texture across KUI, including a one-time Resource Bars migration from Melli and synchronized texture selection for health, primary, and secondary resources.
- Added per-module profile import and export controls to options pages and corrected profile ownership for Action Bars, Bags, Progress Bars, External Addons, Enhancements, and other scoped settings.
- Expanded Nameplates target highlighting with multiple indicator styles, reversible direction, indicator shadow glow, configurable indicator and target-glow colors, scaling, previews, and preset support.
- Refined the Nameplates Display live preview with compact one-row font, outline, and bar-texture selectors, and fixed health-bar clicks so they open the corresponding size settings.
- Improved SharedMedia selectors throughout KUI with complete registered font and texture lists, inline previews, dependable scrolling, and support for media added by other addons.
- Reworked the Cooldown Manager potion tracker with stable combat, health, healthstone, and optional mana slots, selectable potion quality, corrected Midnight item ranks, and combat-safe layout updates.
- Restored Action Bars hotkeys, overlay glows, mouseover behavior, bindings refreshes, and visual enhancements on protected buttons while isolating unsafe cooldown hooks for Midnight APIs.
- Updated Aura Reminders for Midnight Season 2 with locale-independent instance IDs, spell icons, scrollable talent selectors, and compatibility with older name-based reminders.
- Improved Party Frames with selectable SharedMedia health and absorb textures, matching live previews, and missing-buff reminders that ignore non-player companions and scenario NPCs.
- Extended Unit Frames with Melli Reforged defaults, full SharedMedia font and status-bar support per unit, live media previews, and a corrected Default Texture control.
- Reworked Character and Armory navigation with accent-aware Stats, Titles, Equipment, and Progress tabs, more reliable pane visibility, and a compact configuration button beside the close control.
- Hardened Enhanced Friend List raid navigation by passing protected roster clicks through Blizzard's native control and correctly restoring or suppressing the native frame artwork.
- Fixed the dedicated Group chat tab so it receives the complete native group-message set while respecting secure and combat-locked chat restrictions.
- Refined the minimap button drawer so it captures only genuine addon launchers, leaves Expansion Summary, waypoints, POIs, and scanner pins untouched, and restores original button sizes.
- Expanded the Tooltip live preview with real player identity, guild, specialization, faction, item level, Mythic+ or PvP score, raid progress, and class-colored health styling.
- Added a configurable Great Vault skin, refined World Map breadcrumbs and search styling, fixed Ready Check decision labels, and removed the duplicate protected Game Menu skin path.
- Hardened the Escape Menu against FrameMeasurement taint by removing unsafe enumeration of foreign overlay frames anchored to protected nameplates.
- Fixed Ready Check layouts for both incoming and self-initiated checks, removing leftover Blizzard artwork and the empty panel behind consumable trackers.
- Eliminated periodic Cooldown Manager combat freezes by coalescing tracker refreshes and avoiding repeated inventory, tooltip, and item-spell scans.
- Reduced Nameplates interrupt-tracker overhead by replacing global cooldown-event rebuilds with lightweight local ticker updates.
- Expanded /ktfreeze diagnostics with event/addon attribution and Lua allocation/GC tracking without intrusive global CPU polling.
- Reworked Enhancements with a Mythic+ timer that owns its tracker presentation, key details, forces progress, deaths, boss objectives, chest thresholds, and completion state.
- Expanded Mythic+ timer configuration with independent fonts, textures, sizes, widths, heights, colours, glow controls, chest-one, chest-two, chest-three, and forces-bar typography, plus a remaining-time-only display with localized forces text.
- Made SharedMedia font and texture selectors complete and usable throughout Enhancements, including installed fonts and textures, inline preview rendering in dropdowns, left-aligned option labels, and corrected selector placement.
- Reworked Damage Meter configuration and preview with realistic player/spec data, working dynamic Blizzard window discovery, font and texture controls, centered bar layout, selectable spec/class/hidden player icons, rounded icon support, and corrected bar spacing.
- Added automatic LFG role-check controls under Automation & Social, including selectable Tank, Healer, and Damage roles and automatic confirmation when queueing alone or with a group.
- Refined Enhancements navigation with module-specific artwork, accent-coloured icons, the red sword Damage Meter icon, Blizzard chat artwork for Automation & Social, and clearer Interface & Comfort and System Tuning references.
- Hardened LFG and popup skins for current Retail UI changes, including accent-only queue-ready borders, working close buttons, black uncovered popup surfaces, preserved dungeon artwork, and safer handling of native NineSlice and border textures.
- Fixed the KUI Unlock Mode navigation state so closing and reopening the main options window cannot leave Unlock Mode visually selected as the active page.
- Completed the Enhancements localization pass across the supported locales for the new timer, Damage Meter, LFG automation, typography, texture, forces, preview, and navigation strings.
- Restored reliable per-conversation whisper capture on secure-chat builds by mirroring Blizzard-rendered whisper lines into KUI history, including Battle.net conversations, without bypassing the selected whisper thread.
- Hardened Chat integration for protected message and channel data by avoiding unsafe native filter and channel-list mutations, preventing taint attribution and protected-table failures during PvP and other restricted chat dispatches.
- Reworked first-time setup for new characters with a dedicated starting-profile choice, allowing existing saved profiles to be selected or KUI defaults to be used without forcing every character onto the KullThranUI profile.
- Improved Installer and profile startup handling with stable per-character tracking, safer specialization-profile transitions, correct layout imports into the active profile, and more reliable continuation through conflict detection and setup.
- Expanded the Fonts & Colors page with live font previews, a separate Launcher and Options font, individual typography controls for major HUD, social, character, and inspection areas, and additional color controls for interface surfaces, action bars, progress displays, Chat, Armory, and Inspect.
- Reworked global font inheritance so modules that still follow the global font update together while explicitly customized areas preserve their own selection, with combat-safe deferred refreshes across the supported interface.
- Refined the main configuration window with an accent-colored KUI logo, a new resize grip, a slimmer navigation scrollbar, immediate minimap social-icon recoloring, and a scalable nine-slice background that preserves its proportions at preset and custom window sizes.
- Redesigned KUI Unlock Mode with a wider and cleaner sidebar, clearer active-element feedback, improved mover menus, direct access to profile importing, an animated opening logo, and an automatically retracting sidebar that remains available from the edge of the screen.
- Improved the in-game changelog window so its complete ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t show againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â row is clickable, the current patch suppression state is restored correctly, and enabling or disabling the option is saved immediately.
- Hardened Chat against protected edit-box state changes during combat, preventing unsafe whisper, Battle.net, and chat-type mutations while retaining the normal input flow outside combat.
- Reduced Cooldown Manager background work by replacing continuous glow polling with coalesced event-driven updates, refreshing only affected bars when possible, and avoiding redundant transition passes once BlizzardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cooldown Viewer pools have stabilized.
- Improved Cooldown Manager trackers by hiding unavailable potion items, keeping owned potion ranks synchronized, stabilizing player and target frame anchoring around narrow CDM layouts, and making arena, battleground, specialization, and world-transition recovery more selective.
- Reworked centered horizontal Party and Arena layouts so the player remains in the intended middle position as the group fills, with a corrected bottom-center default position for horizontal Party Frames.
- Improved Party Frames range, phase, roster, aura, and encounter handling with more reliable out-of-range recovery, independent dispel indicators, properly layered AuraKit dispel effects, boss-frame activation during encounters, and fewer unnecessary full roster rebuilds while zoning.
- Refined Modern KUI group-interface skins with complete accent borders for selected LFG entries, clearer role-selection feedback, and a rebuilt Ready Check presentation with restored portraits, dedicated Ready and Not Ready buttons, consistent surfaces, and accent-aware artwork.
- Restored reliable first-run Installer startup for new users and brought back the visible "Don't show again" control, with synchronized login settings so the prompt can be disabled or re-enabled cleanly.

- Redesigned the main KullThranUI configuration window around expandable module categories, with dedicated 60x40 category artwork, compact module shortcuts, persistent multi-category expansion, and reliable toggling from both the category row and its arrow.
- Added category overview pages that present every available module as a large shortcut card with its icon and a concise description, while keeping the most recently selected category open in the right-hand panel.
- Corrected category selection and navigation feedback so only the active category remains highlighted, module counts appear only on category overview pages, and expanded categories can coexist without changing the active page.
- Refined the global options presentation with a slightly brighter panel background, consistent category-arrow artwork based on the KUI minimap button, and cleaner icon, spacing, and selected-state behavior throughout the sidebar.
- Reworked private whisper persistence so opened character and Battle.net conversations can survive a UI reload, including conversations opened before any message is exchanged, while closed conversations remain dismissed and session state is cleared on disconnect.
- Hardened Chat against protected and secret strings when capturing whisper targets or copying chat history, and prevented closed temporary Blizzard whisper windows from reopening automatically.
- Corrected Action Bar cooldown presentation so active cooldowns use a properly darkened swipe over every supported button shape instead of retaining the normal colored background.
- Rebuilt Damage Meter player pinning around a Details-style pinned final row: the player remains visible without corrupting the real ranking order, scrolling can inspect the complete list, and combat-start refreshes no longer push the meter to an unrelated position.
- Improved Damage Meter combat-session handling, saved history, protected-value support, and live refresh scheduling to avoid redundant delayed updates during continuous combat events.
- Added a genuinely opaque Objective Tracker background mode with a solid black surface, an accent-colored top border, and an accurate live preview that cannot inherit the legacy gradient or fade.
- Expanded Armory PvP item-level support with a working live-preview indicator and independent controls for visibility, label, decimals, font, size, outline, color, and horizontal or vertical positioning.
- Repositioned Installer Party Frame test controls into a compact left-aligned group so Party, Raid, and Raid 40 tests no longer overlap or distort the live preview.
- Significantly reduced Party Frames update cost through unit-scoped event registration, coalesced aura refreshes, bounded absorb queues, cached aura state, and a centralized duration driver that runs only while required.
- Improved Nameplates runtime efficiency with reusable frame pooling and cached threat, quest-target, and contextual state, reducing repeated allocation and expensive unit scans during combat.
- Optimized Resource Bars to reuse resolved layout and marker data and to update ranges, values, and text only when their relevant unit state changes.
- Extended protected and secret-value safeguards across Party Frames, Resource Bars, Nameplates, Chat, Damage Meter, and other high-frequency combat paths for improved Midnight API compatibility.
- Added and reviewed localization for the new 5.0.0 category pages, Objective Tracker background controls, Armory PvP item-level settings, and related interface text across every supported language.
- Improved package hygiene by removing unused development artifacts, reference trees, duplicate media, temporary scripts, and unreferenced external resources, and added a KullThranUI license that explicitly preserves third-party ownership and licensing terms.
- Reworked the Installer flow so first-time setup opens reliably for every character, reload-required changes return to the exact previous step, and the Installer can be opened directly with `/installer` or `/ins`.
- Expanded the Installer with a dedicated Resource Bars step, clearer module enable and disable behavior, localized reload prompts, improved pressed-state feedback, and the correct KullThranUI background across every page.
- Redesigned Installer previews for Action Bars, Buffs & Debuffs, Party Frames, Resource Bars, Nameplates, and Armory so configuration choices use realistic layouts, class abilities, aura examples, and their actual icon shapes.
- Restored shape support across Action Bars, Buffs & Debuffs, and Cooldown Manager, including masked cooldown swipes, hotkeys rendered above masks, shape-aware selection feedback, and removal of square shadows from non-default shapes.
- Improved cooldown handling for protected and secret values, preventing repeated ActionButton and SetCooldown errors without relying on continuous texture updates.
- Reworked dispel and status overlays in Party Frames and Unit Frames for Magic, Poison, Curse, Disease, and Bleed effects, with the intended diffused presentation across party, raid, arena, and supported dungeon follower frames.
- Fixed friendly units retaining hostile colors after a duel and corrected additional reaction, target, and state refresh edge cases in Unit Frames and Party Frames.
- Improved Nameplates options with correctly initialized default slider values and search-style highlights restricted to the relevant configuration gears instead of covering complete option rows.
- Corrected Armory live previews so empty equipment slots remain empty, displayed stats match the real panel, and movement speed is calculated from the appropriate game values.
- Expanded and refined Modern KUI skins for Trade, Ready Check, Arena Shuffle, group invitations, role popups, PvP inspection, consumable frames, and other Blizzard dialogs.
- Fixed missing role icons in group invitation and acceptance popups, accent colors not applying to Ready Check consumables, and popup errors caused by invalid texture layers or unsafe hooks.
- Improved Enhanced Friend List invite-button styling so the original artwork follows the active accent instead of being replaced or remaining white.
- Reorganized minimap utility buttons outside the map with dedicated Calendar, Tracking, Mail, Friends, Guild, and Teleport Menu controls, consistent Modern KUI backgrounds, accent-aware social icons, and pixel-perfect edge anchoring.
- Separated Teleport Menu from the KullThranUI minimap-button collector, added a dedicated custom portal button and corrected label, and replaced the menu settings icon with the standard KUI gear artwork.
- Reworked Buffs & Debuffs with fully custom AuraKit containers managed through KUI Unlock Mode, preserving existing user positions during migration and applying consistent minimap-relative defaults and spacing.
- Restored the original Masque Simplicity appearance for auras, fixed weapon-enchant text initialization, improved the live preview layout, and made short durations clearly distinguishable from application counts.
- Optimized Buffs & Debuffs aura processing and improved icon reliability under the protected and secret aura restrictions used during combat.
- Reworked Cooldown Manager update scheduling to eliminate redundant full refreshes caused by cooldown and aura event storms, substantially reducing combat CPU usage.
- Fixed inconsistent CDM proc glows, missing or incorrectly spaced buff-bar icons, protected icon visibility errors, and tracking failures after the first use of an ability or item.
- Restored KUI Tracker defensive, racial, potion, and trinket tracking in raids and Mythic+, corrected potion rank and quantity selection, improved cooldown text visibility, and added reliable feedback for passive trinket procs.
- Added a Modern KUI skin for Blizzard's native Cooldown Manager and a direct button in KUI CDM options to open it, with combat-safe loading and proper support for its frame-based side tabs.
- Fixed a severe Bags performance issue caused by cooldown events. Bag item cooldowns now update incrementally, including Hearthstones, while item-level text is restricted to actual equipment.
- Added the `/ktcombat` combat profiler with per-addon CPU deltas, event counters, spike tracking, and detailed CDM phase and bar diagnostics.
- Optimized Party Frames aura and event processing in both idle and combat, restored dispel-type textures, and corrected AFK and Raid Assistant icons across group, raid, and Raid 40 layouts.
- Improved protected-frame handling across Unit Frames, Nameplates, Party Frames, and Cooldown Manager to prevent taint errors and forbidden frame-strata or visibility operations.
- Fixed the Damage Meter scrolling to random ranking sections and ensured that a manually selected top position remains stable while combat data updates.
- Corrected Armory movement-speed calculations and rebuilt stat-label sizing to prevent overlap without unnecessarily truncating Intellect, Stamina, Critical Strike, Mastery, and other labels.

- Repaired Enhanced Friend List layout and interaction regressions, removed the Lua local-variable limit warning and nil-function error, and restored reliable opening, refreshing, and button behavior.
- Fixed missing role artwork in group invitations, the dark lower section of self-initiated Ready Checks, and Release Spirit availability during raid and Mythic boss encounters where releasing is not allowed.
- Fixed Aura Reminders continuing to request food after the player had already eaten from a feast.
- Improved Guild, LFG, popup, and Objective Tracker skin behavior and corrected several profile and localization edge cases.
